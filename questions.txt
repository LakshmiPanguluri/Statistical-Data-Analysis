The attached dataset has deidentified information from a pilot phase of a clinical trial.  The relevant variables are as follows:

admittoenroll: The time (in days) between hospital admission and enrolling in the clinical trial
akistage: the stage of acute kidney injury at the time of enrollment (can be 0, 1, 2, or 3)
akitoenroll: the time (in hours) between acute kidney injury and enrollment
alert: the randomization variable.  1=alert, 0=control
disch_disposition: the outcome of the hospitalization
enrollcreat: the creatinine level at the time of enrollment. Creatinine is a measure of kidney function with higher values indicating WORSE function
enrolltime: the date and time the patient was enrolled in the study
id: the ID variable for the patient
los: the hospital length of stay
maxakistage: the highest stage of acute kidney injury achieved after enrollment
maxcreatpostenroll: the highest creatinine achieved after enrollment
totalalertspt: the number of alerts the patient received


Looking at this data, do your best to answer the following questions.

1. How many individuals were assigned to each randomization group?

2. How would you go about comparing the creatinine level at enrollment across the two groups?  Are they different?

3. How would you go about comparing the maximum achieved creatinine level after enrollment across the two groups?  Are they different?

4. How does the length of stay compare between the two intervention groups?  How would you go about comparing these outcomes?

5. What about inpatient death? What are the findings there?

6. Are there any particular outliers with regards to the time between acute kidney injury and trial enrollment?  How would you identify them?
